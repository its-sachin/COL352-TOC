\section{Question 1}
\textbf{ Show that every infinite Turing-recognizable language has an infinite decidable subset.}\\


\pagebreak


\section{Question 2}

\textbf{Show that single-tape TMs that cannot write on the portion of the tape containing the input
string recognize only regular languages.\\}

\pagebreak


\section{Question 3}

\textbf{Let C be a language. Prove that C is Turing-recognizable iff a decidable language D exists
such that
    \begin{center}
        $C = \{x | \exists y (<x, y> \in D) \}$\\
    \end{center}
}

\pagebreak


\section{Question 4}

\textbf{Say that a variable A in CFL G is usable if it appears in some derivation of some string
w $\in$ G. Given a CFG G and a variable A, consider the problem of testing whether A is
usable. Formulate this problem as a language and show that it is decidable\\}

\pagebreak


\section{Question 5}

\textbf{Consider the problem of determining whether a Turing machine M on an input w ever at-
tempts to move its head left when its head is on the left-most tape cell. Formulate this
problem as a language and show that it is undecidable\\}

\pagebreak


\section{Question 6}

\textbf{Consider the problem of determining whether a Turing machine M on an input w ever at-
tempts to move its head left at any point during its computation on w. Formulate this
problem as a language and show that it is decidable.\\}

\pagebreak


\section{Question 7}

\textbf{Let $AM_{BCFG} = \{< G > | G$ is an ambiguous CFG $\}$ \\
    Show that $AM_{BCFG}$ is undecidable via a reduction from PCP\\}

\pagebreak


\section{Question 8}
\textbf{In the Silly Post Correspondence Problem (SPCP), the top string in each pair has the same
length as the bottom string. Show that the SPCP is decidable.\\}
