\section{Question 2}
\textbf{An all-NFA M is a 5-tuple \boldsymbol{$(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0 , F )$} that accepts \boldsymbol{$x \in \Sigma^{*}$} 
if every possible state that M could be in after reading input x is a state from F . Note, in contrast, that an ordinary NFA 
accepts a string if some state among these possible states is an accept state. Prove that all-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages.}\\
\\
To prove that all-NFA's recognise the class of regular languages we need to show two things, firstly that the language accepted 
by all-NFA's is regular, and secondly given any regular language there exists an all-NFA which accepts it. Following are the proofs of these parts,
\\
\\
\textbf{To Prove:} Language accepted by all-NFA is regular.\\
\textbf{Proof:} Now by the definition, all-NFA M is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0 , F )$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^{*}$ if 
every possible state that M could be in after reading input x is a state from F . This would mean the all-NFA's are NFA because NFA a
ccepts the string even if some of the states reached after reading an input x is in accept state F. NOw we know that the language 
accepted by NFA is regular. Therefore the language accepted by all-NFA is also regular. Hence proved.\\
\\
\textbf{To Prove:} For every regular language there exists an all-NFA that accepts it.\\
\textbf{Proof:} We know that for every regular language there exists a DFA which accepts it. Now the definition of a 
DFA M is that it is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0 , F )$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^{*}$ if the state that M could 
be in after reading input x is a state from F. Now we also know that the set of states DFA M would be in after reading the 
input x is a singleton set (Deterministic nature) and the state belongs to F if x is accepted by DFA. So every DFA is an
 all-NFA. Therefore for every regular language, there exists an all-NFA that accepts it. Hence proved.\\
\\
Now above two facts would imply that the all-NFA's recognize the class of regular languages.

\section{Question 5}

\textbf{For any string \boldsymbol{$w = w_1 w_2 . . . w_n$} the reverse of w written \boldsymbol{$w^R$} is the string 
\boldsymbol{$w_n . . . w_2 w_1$}. For any language A, let \boldsymbol{$A^R ={w^R | w \in A}$}. Show that if A is regular,
 then so is \boldsymbol{$A^R$}. In other words, regular languages are closed under the reverse operation.}\\
\\
As every regular language has a DFA which accepts it, let D be $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F )$ that accepts the language
 A. Now we will construct an NFA N from this DFA. The steps of the construction are given below. We will then show that 
 the language accepted by NFA is indeed $A^R$.\\
\\
\textbf{Construction:} To construct this NFA N we will have to reverse all the edges of the DFA D. Also make the start 
state of the D as the accepting state of the N. Add $\epsilon$ transitions from the accepting states of D to a new state 
$s$ in NFA. Make $s$ the start state of the NFA.\\
So N is $(Q_1, \Sigma, \delta^{'}, q_0^{'} , F^{'} )$ such that
\begin{center}
$Q_1=Q\cup\{s\}$\\
$F^{'}=q_0$\\
$q_0^{'}=s$ \\
$\delta^{'}(q_1,a) = (q_2 \: | \: \delta(q_2,a)=q_1 \: and \: q_1,q_2 \in Q) \cup(s \: |\: q_1\in F\; and \; a=\epsilon)$  
\end{center}
\textbf{To Prove:} The language accepted by N is $A^R$.\\
\textbf{Proof:} Now take any string $w_1 w_2....w_n$ from the language A. The path(path is state then alphabet taken then 
next state reached) taken by this string to accept state in D would be $q_0,w_1,q_1,w_2,q_2.....q_n,w_n,f$ where $q_i\in Q$ 
and $f\in F$. Now take the reverse of the string $w_n w_{n-1}....w_1$. There exist a path from start to accept state in N 
as which is as follows $s,\epsilon,f,w_n,q_n,w_{n-1}.....q_1,w_1,q_0)$. We know that $q_0$ is an accept state of N.
Thus we have got an NFA that has an accepting path for any string w in $A^R$, hence $A^R$ is regular. Hence we have proved 
that regular languages are closed under the reverse operation.
