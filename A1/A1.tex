\section{Question 2}
\textbf{An all-NFA M is a 5-tuple \boldsymbol{$(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0 , F )$} that accepts \boldsymbol{$x \in \Sigma^{*}$} 
if every possible state that M could be in after reading input x is a state from F . Note, in contrast, that an ordinary NFA 
accepts a string if some state among these possible states is an accept state. Prove that all-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages.}\\
\\
To prove that all-NFA's recognise the class of regular languages we need to show two things, firstly that the language accepted 
by all-NFA's is regular, and secondly given any regular language there exists an all-NFA which accepts it. Following are the proofs of these parts,
\\
\\
\textbf{To Prove:} Language accepted by all-NFA is regular.\\
\textbf{Proof:} Now by the definition, all-NFA M is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0 , F )$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^{*}$ if 
every possible state that M could be in after reading input x is a state from F . This would mean the all-NFA's are NFA because NFA a
ccepts the string even if some of the states reached after reading an input x is in accept state F. NOw we know that the language 
accepted by NFA is regular. Therefore the language accepted by all-NFA is also regular. Hence proved.\\
\\
\textbf{To Prove:} For every regular language there exists an all-NFA that accepts it.\\
\textbf{Proof:} We know that for every regular language there exists a DFA which accepts it. Now the definition of a 
DFA M is that it is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0 , F )$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^{*}$ if the state that M could 
be in after reading input x is a state from F. Now we also know that the set of states DFA M would be in after reading the 
input x is a singleton set (Deterministic nature) and the state belongs to F if x is accepted by DFA. So every DFA is an
 all-NFA. Therefore for every regular language, there exists an all-NFA that accepts it. Hence proved.\\
\\
Now above two facts would imply that the all-NFA's recognize the class of regular languages.
